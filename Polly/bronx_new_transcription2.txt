194	CALOGERO                      	1401.115607	1405.915607	They called him Ten to Two because his feet always pointed like the clock, ten to two. 
195	CALOGERO                      	1414.311641	1417.121641	One time he got shot in the leg and they called him twenty after. 
196	CALOGERO                      	1418.111641	1420.431641	But the best times of all were the crap games.

929	CALOGERO                      	5705.069001	5709.379001	I heard it a thousand times. Why does he keep telling me that? Why? 
930	ROSINA                        	5710.896407	5714.726407	Picture him at seventeen- Go on, try.

932	ROSINA                        	5721.832387	5731.592386	Played sax, great dancer, and what a romancer! But I saw something more there from the start—
933	ROSINA                        	5732.775422	5737.175422	That boy had heart. God, he had heart.
934	CALOGERO                      	5737.538291	5741.118291	Dad played the saxophone? Really?

936	ROSINA                        	5747.855272	5751.683344	Dragging that horn to each gig. Bright-eyed kid.
937	ROSINA                        	5751.683344	5757.703344	That dream, he chased it. So close he could taste it.
938	ROSINA                        	5759.835342	5769.375342	And ev'ry note he played, a work of art. Straight from his heart. Boy, he had heart.
939	ROSINA                        	5773.633951	5776.823951	Ask me what happened? Well really, it wasn't dramatic.
940	ROSINA                        	5779.16645	5783.08645	You came along and were kind of a sort of surprise.
941	ROSINA                        	5785.02645	5789.575744	Somehow the sax ended up in a box in the attic.
942	ROSINA                        	5789.575744	5795.095744	I'll tell you the reason. One look in your eyes.
943	ROSINA                        	5796.438669	5800.228669	Each day he gets on that bus. No one cheers.

945	ROSINA                        	5807.493667	5812.743667	Sure, he's tough. You can't budge him. But don't you dare judge him.
946	ROSINA                        	5814.041684	5826.761684	Unless you judge him by his greatest part: Look to his heart. Then look to your heart.
947	CALOGERO_ROSINA               	5830.393292	5837.108162	I'm sorry Ma.,Don't tell me, tell him.
