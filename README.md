# Summer-Projects
In this repository there are many different projects I worked on during the summer of 2018 while working as a Software Development Intern for Galapro, a startup based in Israel. 

You can find projects that include: 

  - A "getPublications" program that downloads and parses publications by any given author from the internet, and creates text files ready to train machine learning language models.
  - A "Polly" program that downloads the text from a broadway script, acquire all the different character's names and output mp3 files with designated voices of each of the characters' lines.
  - A "Script-checker" software that downloads a broadway script from the Galapro servers and compare it to the current script that we have of a current show. 
  - A "Youtube_captions" program that download wav forms of videos from youtube including their subtitles. The output is a txt file that has subtitles and a given wav file with the same name in order to train machine learning speech recognition language models. 
  - A "out_of_vocab" program that takes an unknown dictionary word and finds the context in which this unknown word is used. This is used for language models and machine learning datasets in order to familiarize the AI with unknown words.
  - A "Cleaner" program that cleans unwanted logs in a certain file past a certain date
  - A "Text-align" program that complexly compares two fav files of the same play and matches up the timing based on the timing of the old play. 
  - A "Figure_map" program that retrieves captions and figures for any list of online publications. The use for this is for speech recognition training.
