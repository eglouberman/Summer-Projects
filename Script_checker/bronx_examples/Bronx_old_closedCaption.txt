910	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Webster Avenue. 
911	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Is there a problem with that? Cause I don't think so. There's good and bad in every kind. That’s what you told me right?
912	LORENZO                       	begin_time	end_time	I know what I said but going out with a colored is wrong. Now, I’m not prejudiced –

919	LORENZO                       	begin_time	end_time	I'm going for a walk.
920	LORENZO                       	begin_time	end_time	I'm done with you.
921	ROSINA_CALOGERO               	begin_time	end_time	What the hell is wrong with you?,What?
922	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	Your father puts up with shit all day long on the bus, he doesn't need to come home and get it from you. Why do you hurt him like that?
923	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Everything I say he has a problem with, Ma.
924	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	I'll tell you what the problem is. You look at him and all you see is someone you don't want to be.
925	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	You're right - I don’t wanna be a bus driver.
926	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	You don't get it. He doesn't want that for you.
927	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	What does he always tell you? The saddest thing in life—
928	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	I know...I know... wasted talent.
929	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	I heard it a thousand times. Why does he keep telling me that? Why? (Gentle, somewhat sad music)
930	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Picture him at seventeen- Go on, try. 
931	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Looks that could rival James Dean. Girls would cry.
932	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Played sax, great dancer, and what a romancer! But I saw something more there from the start—
933	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 That boy had heart. God, he had heart.
934	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Dad played the saxophone? Really?
935	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Think that he didn't think big? Sure he did.
936	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Dragging that horn to each gig. Bright-eyed kid.
937	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 That dream, he chased it. So close he could taste it.
938	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 And ev'ry note he played, a work of art. Straight from his heart. Boy, he had heart.
939	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Ask me what happened? Well really, it wasn't dramatic.
940	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 You came along and were kind of a sort of surprise.
941	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Somehow the sax ended up in a box in the attic.
942	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 I'll tell you the reason. One look in your eyes.
943	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Each day he gets on that bus. No one cheers. 
944	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Know why he does it? For us. All these years.
945	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Sure, he's tough. You can't budge him. But don't you dare judge him.
946	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	 Unless you judge him by his greatest part: Look to his heart. Then look to your heart.
947	CALOGERO_ROSINA               	begin_time	end_time	I'm sorry Ma.,Don't tell me, tell him.
948	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Okay…Mom, I really like this girl. 
949	ROSINA                        	begin_time	end_time	Then have a good time. Just be careful. (Music quiets)
950	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 This one could be One of the great ones.
951	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 This one could be one of the ones I won't forget...
952	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 When I see her tonight, there Won't be black or white,
953	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 There's gonna be no one but her.
954	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 And if she is One of my great ones—

1194	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	You pulled me out of that car. I never got a chance to thank you. I told my father what you did and he...
1195	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I was alone.
1196	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	That's okay, kid. It's understandable.
1197	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	This guy here, he's a great man. I loved him. He saved my life. 
1198	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	You're C. Sonny told me about you.
1199	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	What? Sonny told you about me? I'm sorry, I don’t know who you are.

1201	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	You don't remember me do you? Seven, eight years ago in front of your house. You were just a little boy.

1207	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	If you need anything, ANYTHING, you come by the bar and see me. Okay?
1208	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	That's okay, Carmine. I think I'm gonna give the neighborhood a rest for a while...you understand right?
1209	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	I understand, kid. Sonny would be happy to hear that.
1210	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Carmine, he never saw it coming. I tried to warn him but he never knew.
1211	CARMINE_CALOGERO              	begin_time	end_time	He knew.,But it was eight years ago.
1212	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	It's like Sonny used to say, "Revenge is a dish best served cold. So why worry?"
1213	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	So long my friend...and don't worry, I got it.
1214	CARMINE                       	begin_time	end_time	You know where to find me if you need anything. Take care of yourself kid. (High-pitched, pleasant music)
1215	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	Nobody cares? Ha... I guess you were wrong about that one. I'm gonna miss you, Sonny.
1216	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 You said that you had things to teach me. And now, I see it all so clear.
1217	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 We're led, each moment that we live in, To the only choice we're given—
1218	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 Will we live by love or fear? (Drums come in)
1219	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 And you -- you knew it's never easy.
1220	CALOGERO                      	begin_time	end_time	 It's never black or white, just shades of grey. All we do, is face up to those choices,
