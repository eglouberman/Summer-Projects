The following program enables a written command in the console to download a broadway script from the galapro servers and compare it to the current script that we have of a current show. This program determines whether a script needs to be updated or not, given what script is present in the server online. 


Directions: 

Place the new files (all the .py ones) into the same level directory as the current scripts you would like to check if there is an update. 

Type the following into the command line: 

python getJson.py showID showTitle

where showID is the ID of the Json in the Galapro server and showTitle is the name of title as shown in script (Fav) files.
